// the upstream states them (Entra group GUIDs, Logto role names), and any
// meaning they carry belongs to the relying party.

 * The groups a validated id_token asserts, per the provider's groups_source.
 *
 * - `claim`  — the value of `groups_claim`, passed through RAW: no sorting, no
 *              de-duplication, no case folding, no filtering. A relying party
 *              that receives a different list from the one the upstream issued
 *              cannot reason about it.
 * - `none`   — nothing.
 * - `graph`  — nothing, for now. The MS Graph resolver is a later phase
 *              (spec: "Phasing", 4); returning [] here is what that phase
 *              replaces, and is the same non-fatal empty list the current
 *              connector falls back to when Graph fails.
 *
 * Never throws. A provider that is misconfigured, or an upstream that omits
 * the claim or puts something other than an array of strings in it, yields an
 * empty list — a sign-in must not fail over group metadata.
 *
 * An array whose members are not all strings is treated as no group list at
 * all rather than filtered down to the strings in it: dropping members
 * silently would hand the relying party a partial membership that looks
 * complete, which is worse than none.
