 * the rule the plaintext version relied on has to survive verbatim: an absent
 * token must reach the statement as NULL. Encrypting "" (or the string

 * here at all: AES-GCM with a fresh IV encrypts the same token differently
 * every time, so the stored value churns on each sign-in even when the upstream
 * token has not changed. Only null-ness is ever tested, and that is preserved.
 *
 * Failure is fatal to the sign-in by design. The DEK is initialised at boot
 * (index.ts, before server.listen, and a failure there aborts boot), so the
 * only way this throws in practice is a genuinely broken key state — and
