// ── Browser binding ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A signed state proves trex issued it. It does NOT prove the browser
// presenting it is the one that started the flow — and without that, an
// attacker can start a federation flow, authenticate as themselves, keep the
// resulting callback URL instead of following it, and get a victim to open it.
// The victim's browser is then silently signed in as the attacker, and
// everything the victim does next happens in the attacker's account. This is
// login CSRF, the attack `state` exists to prevent; consumeState does not touch
// it, because the attacker never redeems the state themselves.
//
// The fix is the standard one: a random value in a cookie at /authorize, its
// hash inside the signed state, and a comparison at /callback. Only a browser
// holding the cookie can complete the flow the state describes.

/**
 * `__Host-` is the strong form: it forbids a Domain attribute and requires
 * Secure and Path=/, so no sibling subdomain and no plaintext response can set
 * or overwrite it. A browser rejects it outright without Secure, though, which
 * over plain HTTP would leave the cookie unset and every sign-in refused — so a
 * non-HTTPS deployment falls back to the unprefixed name.
 *
 * Exactly ONE name is read per request, chosen by the request's own scheme.
 * Accepting either would hand back the whole attack the prefix exists to stop:
 * a victim who never started a flow holds no `__Host-` cookie, so precedence
 * between the names never comes into play. The attacker reads the binding value
 * off their own Set-Cookie (HttpOnly hides nothing from the party the server
 * sent it to), plants it under the unprefixed name from a sibling subdomain or
 * by injecting over plaintext for any sibling host — neither of which touches
 * this origin — and the victim's browser then presents a value that matches.
 * On a secure request the unprefixed name is therefore ignored even when the
 * prefixed one is absent.
