 * POST the token request, retrying only while the IdP is unreachable.
 *
 * The plugin init functions run as edge-runtime workers, dispatched the moment
 * plugins are registered rather than awaited, so they are not ordered against
 * anything in boot. fhir-init posts here while Logto is still migrating the
 * database trex just provisioned for it; the forward then fails at the
 * transport layer ("error sending request"), the route answers 500, and the
 * init dies for good — taking dataset creation with it. Measured gap between
 * the first failed post and discovery being served: ~16s.
 *
 * Only a throw from fetch is retried. Any HTTP answer is the IdP speaking —
 * including 4xx and 429 — and is handed back untouched, so a bad grant still
 * fails fast instead of being retried into the budget.
