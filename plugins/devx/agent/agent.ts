//      declaring done) that this rewrite otherwise silently dropped from
//      this loop; that steer now also lives in the shared prompt as
//      prompts.ts's D2E_TESTING_BLOCK (part of LOCAL_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT),
//      the same fix applied for every other UI engine that never had it.
//   2. `base` — i.e. this exact file's content, unprocessed by this hook —
//      used to be verbatim what a SELF-DELEGATED SUBAGENT turn ran on: the
//      `agent` built-in ran the subagent as an in-process nested loop
//      (core/server/agents/service/toolset.ts's runSubagent, since deleted)
//      that built its system prompt from the static
//      buildSystemPrompt(target, ctx.metadata) and never called
//      resolveInstructions, so it never reached this function either. That
//      gap is closed at the root: a subagent is now a real CHILD SESSION
//      running an ordinary turn (core/server/agents/service/spawn.ts +
//      handler.ts's startTurn), so it goes through exactly the same
//      per-request path a top-level turn does — resolveInstructions
//      included — and its `base` gets discarded here exactly like a

//      subagent turn gets instead.

// filterTools treats an undefined mode as "no restriction", so the `agent`
// tool is available there. The resulting subagent turn is no longer a
// nested in-process loop with a prompt of its own (toolset.ts's runSubagent,
// deleted): it is a real CHILD SESSION whose first turn goes through
// handler.ts's startTurn like any other, so it builds its system prompt via
// the same per-request resolveInstructions path a top-level turn takes —
// instead of the old static buildSystemPrompt(target, ctx.metadata), which
// never called resolveInstructions and so never reached
// agent.config.buildInstructions (i.e. buildInstructions above). So a
// self-delegated (or explicitly named) devx coder subagent now runs
// buildInstructions the same way a top-level turn does: the resolved
// ai_rules winner, <skills-protocol>, <commit-pr-hygiene>, and the
// cross-repo guard (GENERAL_GUIDELINES_BLOCK, prompts.ts) all reach it. The
// fix lives entirely in core/ — nothing in this file changed to close it.
// plugins/devx/functions/prompt_divergence.test.ts's ENGINES-list guard
// still cannot take credit for that, and still cannot catch a regression of
// it: the guard only ever scans plugins/devx, and the whole child-session
// path lives under core/server/agents/service/, a tree it never opens — see
// that file's header comment for why a green run there is not evidence
