// Task 15: reveals and activates this agent's deferred tools (lib/
// deferred_tools.ts's DEFERRED_TOOLS, wired into agent.ts's
// context.deferredTools in Task 16) by ranked name/description search.
//
// Unlike every other ported tools/<name>.ts file in this directory, this
// one does NOT go through wrap()/toDevxCtx (lib/context.ts): the legacy
// AgentContext that adapter builds has no notion of "activate a tool for
// this session" (nor any need for one, on the AI-SDK loop, where every tool
// is always visible). This file talks to eve's raw ToolContext directly and
// uses its ToolContext.activateTools capability (core/server/agents/
// eve-shim/types.ts, wired in toolset.ts's authoredTool) instead -- the
// narrow "activate my own session's deferred tools" write, not the whole
// AgentStore.
//
// Candidates are read from the legacy TOOL_DEFINITIONS registry (name +
// description -- the same catalog every OTHER ported tool's description
// ultimately traces back to), filtered down to this agent's deferred set.
// Importing registry.ts directly here (not tool_search.ts) is the SAFE
// direction of the pre-existing registry.ts<->tool_search.ts import cycle:
// registry.ts's `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` array literal reads the not-yet-
// initialized `toolSearchTool` binding at module-eval time if tool_search.ts
// is entered first (see that file's own header comment for the full TDZ
// story) -- entering via registry.ts, as this file does, reproduces the
// safe production order instead.

 * filter, delegated wholesale to the legacy toolSearchTool) could not rank
 * at all -- every match was equally relevant, in registry order.
 *
 * Terms match WHOLE TOKENS, not substrings. Substring containment made every
 * short term a wildcard over longer unrelated words: "knowledge base" scored
 * the DB tools highest, because "base" is inside "database" and a name hit
 * outweighs a description hit -- so the query that should surface the
 * knowledge-base tools surfaced ExecuteSQL/DatabaseSchema/TableData instead.
